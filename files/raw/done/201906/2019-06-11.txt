HEADER:PythonBackend Logging System
In order to make program robust and easy to debug,
It's important to add a detailed logging messages.
So that after crash we can recover what happended.
Python has quite strong built-in logging module,
we choose to build out facilities on that.
the usage is like:

import logging
logging.baseConfig()

logging.warning("something bad happended")

HEADER:PythonBackend Logging System Continued
Python is a very cool language, and has its own philosophy.
There is a surpise in standard CPython,
when you execute "import this",
program will print out the famous "Zen of Python".

In "Zen of Python",
there are one sentence related to the loggings:
"Errors should never pass silently. Unless explicitly silenced"

Which means that, we should not handle Errors in a "try-catch"",
Most APIs should explicit throw the Exception it encounters.

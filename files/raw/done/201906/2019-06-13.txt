HEADER:PythonBackend Logging System Continued
The logging module can configure:
    1. where should it display the message,
       could be file(s), console(s), or even across Web.
    2. how serious the message is, there are 6 different levels:
       CRITICAL ERROR WARNING INFO DEBUG NOTSET

while debugging, we set the logging level to DEBUG and above,
and turn it to WARNING and above.

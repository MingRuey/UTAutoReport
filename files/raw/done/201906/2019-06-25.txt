HEADER:PythonBackend Logging System Continued
Thanks to the design of Python built-in logging system,
The formatter previously mentioned is generic,
which means we can use it for all outputs from console to files,
without writing some special logger for each.
For example, for a file logger we can set the formatter:

new_hdlr = logging.FileHandler(file)
formatter = logging.Formatter(fmt=str_format)
new_hdlr.setFormatter(formatter)

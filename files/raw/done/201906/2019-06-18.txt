HEADER:PythonBackend Logging System Continued
Though plain logging the error message is easy,
message may contains confidentials which we should hide.
My solution with the problem is that,
we writing a formatter satisfy the logging module interface.
The formatter accpets "plain text" message,
and encrypts the message then log it,
we will demonstrate the code in next page.
